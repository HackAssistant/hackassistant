# Stats [+](/stats/stats.py)

This app is quite peculiar as it is very easy to develop more stats.

The workflow of this is very similar to the tables and forms. You have the `stats.py` file where all the StatClass are.
You can add how many fields you want from your model with the fields from `base.py`. Then if you want some filter you have to add your filter to the `filters` folder.
That's it, the application will do all the calculation and render of your stats for you.

This has been made with love for the sake of improving the maintenance of this repo. You can test how easy it is to create new stats. Enjoy!
