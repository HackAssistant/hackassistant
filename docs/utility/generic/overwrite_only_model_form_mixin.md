# OverwriteOnlyModelFormMixin [+](/app/mixins.py)

I have a model that is being shared across many forms. An ugly side effect of this was that if I ever forgot to ensure that the HTML rendered contained *exactly* the fields defined in the form, django would overwrite the values.

Hereâ€™s a mixin that you can add to any ModelForm which will only update values.

Note that this still allows users to update a model field explicitly with a blank.
