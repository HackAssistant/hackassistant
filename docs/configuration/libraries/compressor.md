# Django Compressor [+](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Compresses linked and inline JavaScript or CSS into a single cached file.

## Features

- Compress Bootstrap 5 styles for the application at [theme.scss](/app/static/css/theme.scss).

## Integration to Hackassistant

Just installed as the library documentation says and installed a [cron job](crontab.md) to renew the compression as it has expiration.

## Future work

This can be useful in the future for other compressions.
