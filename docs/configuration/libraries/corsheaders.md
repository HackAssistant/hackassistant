# Django-cors-headers [+](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/)

A Django App that adds Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to responses.

## Features

- This allows in-browser requests to your Django application from other origins.

## Integration to Hackassistant

- This is used by the [Django JWT](django_jwt_oidc.md) and allows the other services to use apis from the Hackassistant.
- You can add more pages with the configuration in the library documentation.

## Future work

- No APIs for the moment but can be implemented for your hackathon organization.
